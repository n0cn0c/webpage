        <h2>Civil Engineering Branches</h2>
        <p>Civil engineering covers a wide range of sub-disciplines. Here are some of the main branches:</p>

        <h3>1. Structural Engineering</h3>
        <p>This branch focuses on the design and analysis of structures that can support or resist loads. Structural engineers ensure that buildings, bridges, and other structures are safe and capable of withstanding external forces.</p>

        <h3>2. Geotechnical Engineering</h3>
        <p>Geotechnical engineering deals with the behavior of earth materials, such as soil and rock, and how they interact with foundations, tunnels, and other structures. This branch is crucial in construction projects where soil stability is a concern.</p>

        <h3>3. Environmental Engineering</h3>
        <p>Environmental engineers focus on improving and protecting the environment. This includes working on projects that reduce pollution, manage waste, and develop sustainable solutions for water and air quality.</p>

        <h3>4. Transportation Engineering</h3>
        <p>Transportation engineering involves the design, construction, and maintenance of transportation systems such as roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways. This branch ensures that transportation systems are efficient and safe.</p>

        <h3>5. Water Resources Engineering</h3>
        <p>Water resources engineers focus on the management of water resources. They work on projects related to water supply, irrigation, flood control, and the development of water treatment facilities.</p>
